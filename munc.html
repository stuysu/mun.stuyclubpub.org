                                           <p>The first committee of the United Nations General Assembly is the The Disarmament and International Security Committee. It was created along with the United Nations in 1945 with the purpose of handling global threats to peace. Thus, DISEC plays a large role in maintenance of international peace and security, especially in times of conflict. There are countless issues plaguing the world today, including the war against ISIS and the increasing tensions between nuclear nations. So, for this conference’s purpose, we will be focusing on these two topics: nuclear nonproliferation and the relationship between terrorism and the media.
Though the advent of nuclear power is economically advantageous, this fuel can also be used for harm. Nuclear weapons not only create mass destruction, but also have adverse effects on the environment. The possession of these deadly weapons fuels tensions among nations, creating an unsafe global atmosphere.
Terrorism itself threatens the lives of those throughout the world. Despite the efforts of the international community to combat terrorism, insurgent groups have only been gaining power through social media which is a major outlet for their recruitment. Furthermore a direct has been drawn between media coverage and terrorist activity.

                          <p>Founded in 1993, SPECPOL is the result of a merge between The Decolonization Committee and the Special Political Committee. Also known as The Fourth Committee of the General Assembly, SPECPOL  serves to mediate discussions on unique political situations as well as the related issue of decolonization and politically motivated territorial disputes. The first topic this committee hopes to address in order to deal with these issues are the rebel groups that currently control parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With many rebel groups vying for power, desiring access to land and resources as well as political control, the late 2016 election will have major effects in the future of the government of the DRC.  Many of the main groups in this long battle for power include the FDLR, ADF, and Mai-Mai groups are very militarily abusive. Corruption in the government and abuses amongst UN workers increases the necessity for an effective leader however with the current contenders for power the corrupt government seems to be leaning towards an abusive government which has called into question whether international intervention would be effective. International intervention has already been taken in the second topic we hope to discuss: the annexation and governance of Crimea. Russia’s 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula was an audacious display of Russia’s desire to reclaim former soviet territory that triggered a global response. Russia faced political and economic repercussions for their expansion as well as the death of six individuals during their annexation. Even today their are still disputes over who controls Crimea amid increasing Russian military presence in the region.

                 <p>The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is one of the largest and most influential governing bodies of the UN. Their focus on development is often an overlooked aspect of the UN. They work with countries to develop policy and build political infrastructure as well as working to eradicate poverty. The UNDP was founded in 1965 after the Expanded Program of Technical Assistance (EPTA) and the Untied Nations Special Fund (UNSF) merged creating a larger and more expansive governing body. In this committee session, we will focus on two main issues that effect the UNDP and the UN as a whole. The first topic, providing relief efforts to Haiti after Hurricane Matthew, will address the more humanitarian aspects of the UNDP. Our second topic, setting up stable governments in war torn areas, will work on the development aspect of UNDP.</p>

                      <p>This committee, which was originally founded in July of 2010 as a committee of the General Assembly of the United Nations, was created in order to address the increasingly prevalent issues regarding the gender inequality in various nations all over the world. With more and more awareness of the gender gap, several initiatives are being taken to diminish the disparity, especially in conservative, patriarchal nations. This can be seen in women’s education, especially when it is reflected in the professional workforce, and also in the household, where several women fall victim to domestic violence. The longer we put this issue on hold, the more detrimental it becomes, so it is imperative that this committee will need to determine the policies needed to let women effectively rise to power. During this conference, we will generally be functioning as a general assembly committee, but with fewer delegates.

                           <p>Since the dawn of time man has waged war unchecked. Today we have the ability to change this with a pivotal agreement to dictate the rules of engagement. With weapons advancing to include the use of chlorine gas in World War I, and nuclear bombs in World War II, and the Nuremberg Trials revealing the inhumanity that comes to rise in times of war, the international community has decided that action must be taken. So rise up now, my fellow statesman, and come forth to set a status quo that will stand the test of time and war alike. A series of rules that will maintain our fragile humanity in spite of the rising tide of dangerous technological warfare and systematic oppression. Delegates will be challenged to come with a clear set of regulations for how conflict can be waged in a future that values the lives of innocents and the dignity of those participating.

                                <p>It’s May 14th 1787. We have gathered here in Philadelphia for the Constitutional Convention. This is our opportunity to codify the tenants of our new nation in a document that will guide our progeny. Delegates from the thirteen colonies are here, many of whom have striking disagreements on how to proceed. What shall we do about the issue of slavery? Who should be allowed to vote and how should our electoral system function? Should power lie with the federal government or with the states? We must draft a system of representation and devise an amendment process. The task before us all is great. We need to compromise to create a document, a model of democracy for all the world to see. I, General George Washington, will do my best to lead, but it is up to you delegates. The fate of America rests with all of you.

As the drama unfolds beyond the Iron Curtain, the North Atlantic Council, the principal decision-making body of NATO, meets to discuss, debate, and decide on what to do next, knowing full well that any action NATO or any of its member states takes might very well influence the fate of the world. The North Atlantic Council will be a specialized/crisis committee. Delegates will be operating in a fast-paced, rapidly changing environment and are expected to respond quickly and appropriately, either as a body or as individuals, to various scenarios that they will encounter, the most prominent and pressing of which is the imminent collapse of the Soviet Union.

<p>Weeks after the attacks in September 11th, 2001, the United States is in a state of crisis. New York City’s World Trade Center has been attacked, with devastation within the financial capital of the nation. The Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense Fear, has been targeted as well, resembling an additional threat to national security. Speculation of terrorist links to these attacks is growing among worried American citizens, thus immediate action is necessary to alleviate the crisis and assure their security and safety. The committee will need to assess the attacks and determine what path the U.S. will take in rectifying this conflict. If this was a foreign attack, it would be the deadliest of its kind on American soil since the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, and the worst terrorist attack in world history. The committee will be responsible for assessing the repercussions of these attacks, and answer the tough questions concerning how the country will proceed. Is this a terrorist attack associated with al-Qaeda? Must Osama Bin Laden, leader of the terrorist organization, be captured and killed to ensure no further attacks? How will a campaign in Afghanistan fair with the Afghan government? And perhaps most importantly, how will such massive threats to national security be avoided in the future?

     <p>South China Sea- In the post-Cold War political world, the South China Sea (SCS) stands as one of the of the world’s regions that is most prone to inter-state escalation and conflict. This is largely due to the large amounts of energy resources, both proven and as of yet untapped, in addition to sea-lanes that are of major economic and military importance. Complicating this is the fact that many international territorial disputes have emerged; worryingly, littoral states among the SCS alone have increased military outlays over 50% in the last 10 years alone. Once military commitments and alliances, like the ones with the United States, are taken into account, the SCS stands as one of the world’s most precarious security situations. This committee will confront the issues in the South China Sea, as this one of the world’s most prominent geopolitical crises and one that we hope will lead to fruitful debate and action in committee.


New Nuclear Weapons Programs- Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons ever invented by mankind. Since World War II, the United Nations Security Council members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States – have possessed nuclear weapons. India and Pakistan have also developed nuclear weapons. Israel is suspected of having nuclear weapons and has strategically maintained uncertainty about its status. North Korea has recently conducted nuclear weapons testing, and Iran has been accused of developing nuclear weapons as well. Several countries had nuclear weapons but have since surrendered them or disassembled them, including South Africa and the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Countries are worried about the spread of nuclear weapons and want to stop other countries from obtaining them. These efforts are called nuclear non-proliferation. The 21st century has also presented new problems. It will be up to the countries in this committee to deal with new nuclear weapons programs

          <p>It is April 15, 2016, and the fate of Britain and the entire international community hangs in the balance. Prime Minister David Cameron has set the table for a referendum on British membership in the European Union and now, after decades of being forced to bow to the tyrannical rule of the technocrats in Brussels, the British people finally have the opportunity to fight for their independence. In the Leave Committee, you will take on the role of a key member of the Vote Leave coalition, pitted in a vicious political struggle to advance the cause of British freedom. The referendum campaign will be brutal, and we will have to brave the corruption of the mainstream media, the dirty tricks and lies of the Remain team, and partisan battles. This hardwork and sacrifice, however, is done for the wellbeing of the British people and the glory of our island. Rule, Britannia! God save the Queen!

               <p>The European Union is a political and economic alliance between twenty-nine European nations that has existed since 1993. The United Kingdom has been a vital member of this organization, providing and receiving both supplementary strength and strong trading assets. The people of the United Kingdom are contentious, torn along two sides of an issue with roots planted in the founding of the EU itself. The motion to leave the European Union, dubbed “Brexit,” has taken the UK by storm, through social uproar that comes down to the very individual. It is up to this committee to make the better choice and prevail over its opposing delegates in our Leave counterpart. In today’s world it is more important than ever to remain an integral member of the European Union for the sake of both internal and external affairs. In committee, discussion will create and address various questions that must be solved to maintain unity with the rest of Europe. How will you effectively convince the people of the UK to stay a member of the EU? What would be the effects of remaining or leaving for the international community? And most importantly, What does this mean for the future of the United Kingdom?</p>
